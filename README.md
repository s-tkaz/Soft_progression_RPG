Project: RPG Gold Economy Simulation

Goal: Balance player progression to maintain engagement without excessive grind.

Approach: Designed gold earning and spending loops using formula-based progression.

Outcome: Identified that balancing upgrade cost as a quadratic function and rewards as a slightly exponential function gives the best pacing.

Tools Used: Google Sheets (for modeling), graphs (for visualizing balance).

Future Work: Add second currency for cosmetic purchases or test variable difficulty scaling.
